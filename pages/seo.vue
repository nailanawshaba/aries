        <span class="tab">&#9;</span> Wisdom is a word, like many others, which is used to describe a certain quality.  To use the word wisdom is simple, to understand the quality of wisdom is more involved.  The beginning of wisdom is to act according to experience, knowledge and good judgment.  This is different from knowledge because knowing is not the same as acting based on knowledge--this is wisdom.  Often the two are used interchangeably but we are concerned with understanding the quality of wisdom not simply using the word.  Furthermore, to understand the quality of wisdom, it is also necessary to understand what it means to understand.  To understand is also a quality that is self-documenting in its meaning.  It means that if we stand on our understanding, the foundation underneath should be strong and reliable.  It should not move, be brittle, or vary in its dimensions.  A foundation, in this sense, would be considered inappropriate to stand or build any structure on.  Now if one understands both the quality of understanding and of wisdom then one sees how words are actions, albeit granular ones, and like all actions, should be taken based on experience, knowledge and good judgment.
